# Archive - December 2025

This folder contains documentation artifacts archived during repository hygiene sessions.

## Contents

### `/deployment-reports/`
One-time deployment summaries and checklists. These documents captured point-in-time deployment state and are preserved for historical reference.

- `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` - AgentTool refactor deployment steps
- `DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY-PL010.md` - Volume aggregation fix deployment
- `PL-006-DEPLOYMENT-REPORT.md` - NEPA Advisor search-first fix

### `/fix-reports/`
Critical fix documentation. These captured specific bug fixes and their solutions.

- `CRITICAL-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - AgentTool pattern implementation

## Why Archived

These files were created during active development sprints and served their purpose as communication artifacts. They are now:

1. **Superseded** by ADRs (architecture decisions) and runbooks (operational procedures)
2. **Point-in-time** artifacts that don't reflect current state
3. **Root-level clutter** that complicated repository navigation
