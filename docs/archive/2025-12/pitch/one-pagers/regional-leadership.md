## Executive Summary

RANGER is a multi-agent AI platform that coordinates post-fire forest recovery analysis. It connects burn severity, trail damage, timber salvage, and NEPA compliance through specialized AI agents that work together—compressing weeks of disconnected analysis into hours of unified intelligence.

---

## Strategic Alignment

| USDA Priority | RANGER Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| AI-assisted decision support | Multi-agent coordination with reasoning transparency |
| Natural language interfaces | Conversational queries, not GIS expertise required |
| Auditability | Full citation trail for every recommendation |
| Cost efficiency | Zero licensing fees; $6-9K/year operating cost |

---

## Key Differentiators

**vs. Commercial Platforms (Esri, Palantir)**
- No licensing fees ($0 vs. $100K-$1M+/year)
- Open source, no vendor lock-in
- Forest recovery specific, not general-purpose

**vs. Existing USFS Systems**
- Integration layer, not replacement
- Natural language interface
- AI synthesis across domains

## Proof of Concept Results

Using Cedar Creek Fire (2022) historical data:

| Metric | Traditional | RANGER |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Briefing assembly | 2+ hours | 5 minutes |
| Cross-domain synthesis | Manual | Automatic |
| NEPA citation lookup | 30+ minutes | Instant |
| Decision audit trail | None | Complete JSON export |

---

## Risk Posture

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| AI accuracy | Human-in-the-loop; AI recommends, humans decide |
| Data security | FedRAMP High authorized infrastructure (GCP) |
| Vendor dependency | Open source; portable to other clouds |
| Staff adoption | Familiar chat interface; no retraining required |

---

## The Ask

Pilot program participation in Q1 2026. We need:
- One fire recovery incident as test case
- 30 minutes for demonstration
- Feedback on operational fit
