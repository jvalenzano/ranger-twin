# RANGER Documentation Archive

**Purpose:** This directory preserves historical documentation, session logs, and design artifacts that have been superseded by the Skills-First architecture (**ADR-005**) and the **IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md**.

## Archive Structure

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `session-logs/` | Historical development journals and progress logs (e.g., `PROGRESS-2025.md`). |
| `milestones/` | Documentation for completed project milestones. |
| `phase1/` | Strategy and manifestos from the Phase 1 static demo. |
| `technical-audits/` | Deep-dives into specific technical problems (e.g., map simplification). |
| `ux-reviews/` | Historical feedback from UX workshops and product reviews. |
| `research/` | Early research into agents, skills, and strategic architecture. |
| `audits/` | Records of previous documentation and code audits. |
| `testing/` | Outdated test plans and workflow checklists. |
| `design-history/` | Wireframes and early mockup iterations. |

## Why Archive?

As RANGER evolves toward a production-ready system, we maintain "Single Sources of Truth" in the root `docs/` directory. Archiving prevents confusion between current architectural mandates and historical exploration while preserving the project's institutional memory.
