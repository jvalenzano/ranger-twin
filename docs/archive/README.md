# Archive

This folder contains ideation artifacts and research documents from the initial project exploration phase. They are preserved for reference but are not part of the active documentation.

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were created during rapid ideation and may contain:
- Outdated assumptions about scope
- Detailed technical plans that don't apply to Phase 1
- Session logs and working notes
- Research that has been superseded by DATA-SIMULATION-STRATEGY.md

## To Restore a Document

If you need to reference or restore any of these documents, simply move them back to their original location in `docs/`.
