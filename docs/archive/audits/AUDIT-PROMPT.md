# RANGER: Strategic Audit & Handoff Brief

## Prioritized Document Review List

Review these documents in order to understand the "Agentic OS" vision and the "Agentic Synthesis" briefing model.

1.  **[PROJECT-BRIEF.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md)** - **Critical Priority.** The source of truth. Defines the "Agentic OS" positioning and the three critical risk mitigations (Just Another Map, Adoption Inertia, ADK Orchestration).
2.  **[STRATEGIC-REFRAME.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/STRATEGIC-REFRAME.md)** - Architectural context for the move to a root Coordinator pattern.
3.  **[CLAUDE.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/CLAUDE.md)** - High-level technical overview and developer guidance.
4.  **[RECOVERY-COORDINATOR-SPEC.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/agents/RECOVERY-COORDINATOR-SPEC.md)** - The technical spec for the root agent. Needs review: Does it actually support the "Coordinated Briefing" model?
5.  **[DATA-STRATEGY.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/research/DATA-STRATEGY.md)** - The "Golden Thread" narrative. Does the data actually flow between agents as a "briefing"?
6.  **[agents/README.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/agents/README.md)** - The crew overview and "digital colleague" philosophy.
7.  **[UX-VISION.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/architecture/UX-VISION.md)** - The "Tactical Futurism" UI and shared chrome vs. view-specific content.
8.  **[SPRINT-FOCUS.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/SPRINT-FOCUS.md)** - Immediate priorities. Are these still valid after the "briefing" shift?
9.  **[MARKET-RESEARCH.md](file:///Users/jvalenzano/Projects/ranger-twin/docs/research/MARKET-RESEARCH.md)** - Competitive landscape and original risk register.

## The Audit Prompt

**Role:** Senior AI Systems Auditor & Product Strategist.
**Mindset:** Rigorous, critical, and anti-hallucination. You are tasked with dismantling the strategy to find its weakest points before we commit technical resources.

**Task:**
Review the RANGER documentation according to the **Prioritized Document Review List**. Your goal is to validate if the current strategy successfully transitions from a "GIS Dashboard" to a true **"Agentic OS for Natural Resource Recovery."**

**Audit Criteria:**
1.  **Briefing vs. Data:** Does the architecture support "Agentic Synthesis" (coordinated briefings) or is it still just piping raw data to a map? Look for "The Just Another Map Trap."
2.  **Legacy Gravity:** Is the "Digital Wrapper" strategy deeply enough embedded to overcome USFS adoption inertia? Check the agent specs for FSVeg/TRACS compatibility.
3.  **Orchestration Depth:** Is the Recovery Coordinator a true "brain" (session state, cross-agent memory via Google ADK) or just a simple router?
4.  **The Golden Thread:** Does the Cedar Creek narrative actually hold up under technical scrutiny? Does the data from the Burn Analyst logically and technically feed the Trail Assessor?

**Objective:**
Identify the top 3 remaining strategic "rabbit holes" and propose specific technical or documented refinements to close them. Do not approve the plan until it is airtight.
