## 1. Cedar Creek Context (P0)

**Output File:** `cedar-creek-context.png` (simulates `Cedar Creek Fire 2022.png`)
**Concept:** The "Why we are here" context slide.

```
Tactical briefing infographic, dark slate chalkboard style, dramatic aerial
perspective of Oregon's Cascade Range wildfire scene.

Central composition: Bird's-eye view of Waldo Lake (distinctive pristine blue
oval) with mosaic burn severity patterns (patches of green, amber, red showing
varied damage) spreading westward toward Oakridge. Massive pyrocumulonimbus
cloud tower rising. Retardant planes and helicopter with water bucket.
Topographic contour lines visible.

Top header: "CEDAR CREEK FIRE • WILLAMETTE NATIONAL FOREST • 2022"

Key stats (top left): "127,311 ACRES • $58M • 2,000+ EVACUATED"

Oregon locator map (top right corner): State silhouette with Portland, Eugene
marked, fire location glowing amber.

Timeline strip (bottom center):
"AUG 1: ¼ acre → SEPT 8: EAST WINDS → SEPT 11: 86,000 acres (4 DAYS) → NOV 22:
CONTAINED"

Four assessment domain icons (bottom, above timeline):
🔥 BURN SEVERITY | 🥾 TRAIL DAMAGE | 🌲 TIMBER | 📋 NEPA

Bottom corners: USDA Forest Service shield (left), RANGER AGENTIC OS badge
(right)

Small annotation near Oakridge: "Level 3 Evacuation - Sept 9"
Small annotation near fire origin: "Rappellers refused - terrain too hazardous"

Style: Dark tactical military briefing aesthetic, chalk and graphite textures,
burnt orange and amber fire tones, cool blue lake contrast, cream annotations.
Emergency operations center mood. Illustrated tactical map, not photorealistic.

## 2. The Legacy Bridge (P0)

**Output File:** `legacy-bridge.png`
**Concept:** Modern AI augmenting legacy systems without replacing them.

```
Create a technical whiteboard diagram titled "The Legacy Bridge: Augmentation, Not Replacement"

Style: Clean engineering whiteboard aesthetic. Dark slate blue background.

Layout: Left (New) -> Bridge (Transform) -> Right (Old).

LEFT SECTION - "Modern RANGER (AI)"
Sleek, futuristic card UI.
Content: "Trail Assessor Briefing"
Data: "Damage: Washout, Cost: $45k"
Visual: Glowing, modern interface.

CENTER SECTION - "The Bridge"
Visual: A literal architectural bridge.
Label: "Schema Transformer"
Gears turning, converting JSON to CSV/XML.
Caption: "Zero Data Loss"

RIGHT SECTION - "Legacy Systems (USFS)"
Two retro-styled computer terminals (90s aesthetic).
1. Terminal "TRACS": Showing CSV import screen. Green Checkmark.
2. Terminal "FSVeg": Showing XML import screen. Green Checkmark.

BOTTOM CAPTION:
"The fastest path to adoption isn't replacing legacy systems—it's making them smarter."

## 3. The Recovery Chain (P0)

**Output File:** `recovery-chain-personas.png`
**Concept:** Human personas triggering each other in a coordinated workflow.

```
Create a technical whiteboard diagram titled "The Cedar Creek Recovery Chain: Four Personas, One Mission"

Style: Clean engineering whiteboard aesthetic. Dark slate blue background.
Layout: Circular flow.

TOP-LEFT - "Sarah Chen (FMO)"
Icon: Fire Chief.
Action: "Identifies high severity zones" -> Triggers Trail Tech.

TOP-RIGHT - "Marcus Rodriguez (Rec Tech)"
Icon: Hiker/Ranger.
Action: "Assesses trail closures" -> Informs Timber Cruiser.

BOTTOM-RIGHT - "Elena Vasquez (Cruiser)"
Icon: Forester.
Action: "Calculates salvage value" -> Triggers NEPA.

BOTTOM-LEFT - "Dr. James Park (NEPA)"
Icon: Scientist/Clipboard.
Action: "Checks compliance" -> Feedback to FMO.

Center Hub: "Shared Context (Correlation ID)"
Caption: "4 Silos -> 1 Team"
```

## 4. The Confidence Ledger (P1)

**Output File:** `confidence-ledger.png`
**Concept:** Trust architecture (Scores, Citations, Reasoning).

```
Create a technical whiteboard diagram titled "The Confidence Ledger: Trust Architecture"

Style: Clean engineering whiteboard aesthetic. "Audit Trail" metaphor.

Top Comparison:
Left: "Black Box AI" (Red X) -> "Trust me bro"
Right: "RANGER" (Green Check) -> "Here is the evidence"

Three Pillars of Proof (Visualized as columns/badges):
1. "Confidence Score" (Gauge at 87%)
   - Factors: Data Quality, Model Certainty
2. "Citation Chain" (Document links)
   - "FSM 2353.03", "Video Frame 0:42"
3. "Reasoning Chain" (Step-by-step logic)
   - "1. Detected crack... 2. Evaluated risk..."

Bottom:
