# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-12-19
**Decision Makers:** TechTrend Federal - Digital Twin Team

> **Note:** This ADR documents the full stack architecture. Phase 1 uses a subset of these technologies with simulated data inputs. See [DATA-SIMULATION-STRATEGY.md](../DATA-SIMULATION-STRATEGY.md) for Phase 1 scope boundaries.

## Context

We are building an AI-first digital twin platform for post-fire forest recovery. The platform must:

1. Support five specialized AI agents (BurnAnalyst, TrailAssessor, CruisingAssistant, NEPAAdvisor, RecoveryCoordinator)
2. Provide a "Tactical Futurism" UI for desktop command centers
3. Support offline-capable mobile field data capture
4. Be FedRAMP High compliant for federal deployment
5. Minimize licensing costs—investment should go to AI capabilities, not application licensing

## Decision

We will adopt a **"Zero Licensing" open source stack** with strategic use of GCP managed services.

### Infrastructure

| Choice | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **GCP** | FedRAMP High authorized, Vertex AI integration, public satellite data | AWS GovCloud, Azure Government |
| **Cloud Run** | Serverless containers, scale-to-zero, cost-effective for seasonal workloads | GKE, Cloud Functions |
| **Cloud SQL** | Managed PostgreSQL with PostGIS, FedRAMP High | Self-managed, AlloyDB |
| **Cloud Storage** | Public Sentinel-2/Landsat buckets, no egress for same-region processing | S3 |
| **Terraform** | Industry standard IaC, good GCP provider | Pulumi, CloudFormation |

## Phase 1 vs. Full Stack

The following table clarifies which components are active in Phase 1 (simulation-based) versus the full production vision:

| Component | Phase 1 | Full Stack | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Frontend** |
| React 18 + TypeScript | ✓ | ✓ | Core UI framework |
| Vite | ✓ | ✓ | Development server |
| Tailwind CSS | ✓ | ✓ | Styling system |
| MapLibre GL JS | ✓ | ✓ | Base map rendering |
| deck.gl | ✓ | ✓ | WebGL data visualization |
| Recharts | ✓ | ✓ | Simple charts |
| **Backend** |
| FastAPI | ✓ | ✓ | API gateway |
| PostgreSQL + PostGIS | ✓ | ✓ | Spatial database (minimal Phase 1 usage) |
| pgvector | ✓ | ✓ | RAG for NEPA Advisor (limited corpus Phase 1) |
| Redis | ✓ | ✓ | Session state management |
| Celery | ✗ | ✓ | Async task queue (not needed for static fixtures) |
| **AI/ML** |
| Google Gemini 2.0 Flash | ✓ | ✓ | Agent reasoning and synthesis |
| Google ADK | ✓ | ✓ | Multi-agent orchestration |
| LangChain | ✓ | ✓ | RAG framework |
| OpenAI Whisper | ✗ | ✓ | Simulated in Phase 1 |
| YOLOv8 | ✗ | ✓ | Simulated in Phase 1 |
| SAM2 | ✗ | ✓ | Simulated in Phase 1 |
| geemap | ✗ | ✓ | Simulated in Phase 1 |
| **Infrastructure** |
| GCP Cloud Run | ✓ | ✓ | Serverless containers |
| Cloud SQL | ✓ | ✓ | Managed PostgreSQL |
| Cloud Storage | ✓ | ✓ | Static fixtures (Phase 1), satellite data (Full) |
| Terraform | ✓ | ✓ | Infrastructure as code |

**Phase 1 Strategy:** Simulated data inputs (static JSON/GeoJSON fixtures) + real agent orchestration + real Gemini synthesis. See [DATA-SIMULATION-STRATEGY.md](../DATA-SIMULATION-STRATEGY.md) for complete details.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Zero application licensing costs** - All application components are open source
2. **AI investment focus** - Budget goes to Gemini API, model training, agent development
3. **FedRAMP compliance** - GCP services are FedRAMP High authorized
4. **Serverless cost optimization** - Scale-to-zero during off-season (80%+ savings)
5. **No vendor lock-in** - Open source stack is portable; data in standard formats
6. **Strong ecosystem** - All choices have active communities and documentation

### Negative

1. **GCP dependency** - Vertex AI ties us to Google Cloud (mitigated by using standard APIs)
2. **Self-managed complexity** - Some components (GeoServer, Whisper) require operational expertise
3. **Integration work** - Open source tools require more integration than commercial suites
4. **Limited commercial support** - Rely on community support vs. vendor SLAs

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| MapLibre performance issues | Low | deck.gl handles heavy lifting; MapLibre for base maps only |
| Whisper accuracy insufficient | Medium | Can fall back to Gemini audio API; human review loop |
| pgvector scale limitations | Low | BigQuery + Vertex AI Vector Search as backup |
| Team learning curve | Medium | Strong documentation; pair programming; focused scope |

## Cost Estimate

### Monthly (Active Fire Season)

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Cloud Run (API + Agents) | $150-300 |
| Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) | $100-200 |
| Cloud Storage | $30-50 |
| Vertex AI (Gemini API) | $100-300 |
| BigQuery | $25-75 |
| Other (CDN, Logging, etc.) | $50-100 |
| **Total** | **$455-1,025/month** |

### Annual Estimate

- Active season (6 months): $2,730-6,150
- Off-season (6 months): $600-1,200
- **Annual Total: $3,330-7,350**

Compare to commercial alternatives:
- Esri ArcGIS Enterprise: $100K+/year
- Palantir Foundry: $1M+/year
- Custom enterprise build: $500K+/year
