## What is RANGER?

RANGER is an AI-powered coordination platform for post-fire forest recovery. Instead of assembling briefings from 14 different systems, RANGER gives you a unified view with AI specialists that work together—just like a well-functioning team.

## The Problem

| Current State | With RANGER |
|---------------|-------------|
| 2+ hours assembling morning briefing | 5 minutes to review AI-generated briefing |
| 14 separate data systems | One unified interface |
| Decisions based on incomplete data | Cross-domain synthesis |
| NEPA memos take 8+ hours | Draft memos with citations in 1 hour |
| "What changed overnight?" is manual | Automatic change detection |

## How It Works

**One question triggers four AI specialists:**

1. **Burn Analyst** → Fire severity and erosion risk
2. **Trail Assessor** → Infrastructure damage and closures
3. **Cruising Assistant** → Timber salvage viability
4. **NEPA Advisor** → Compliance pathway with citations

The Recovery Coordinator synthesizes their findings into a unified briefing—with confidence scores and source citations for every insight.

## What Makes It Different

✓ **Transparent** — Every recommendation shows its reasoning  
✓ **Auditable** — Export full decision trail for IG/FOIA  
✓ **Federal-Ready** — Built on FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure  
✓ **Free** — No licensing fees (open source)

## The Ask
