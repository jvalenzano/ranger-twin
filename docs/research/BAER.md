The three-phase model (Active → In BAER → In Recovery) captures the core USFS post-fire lifecycle but requires refinement for precision, as official frameworks distinguish fire suppression from post-containment phases and include sub-phases like assessment and implementation. BAER focuses on emergency stabilization (up to 1 year post-containment) to protect life/property/resources, while longer-term efforts address rehabilitation/restoration over years. Not all fires progress linearly—smaller ones may skip BAER, large/complex ones add monitoring or suppression repair first; transitions trigger on containment (to BAER), funding approval (implementation), or natural recovery thresholds.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Phase Refinements
- Add **Suppression Repair** pre-BAER for fire ops damage (e.g., dozer lines).[3]
- Split BAER into **Assessment** (7-21 days, 50-80% containment) and **Implementation** (within 3 days of approval, before first storm).[4]
- Extend Recovery to **Rehabilitation/Restoration** with 3-year monitoring; include **Monitoring** sub-phase.[6][1]
- Durations: Active (days-weeks), BAER (weeks-1 year), Recovery (years).[7]

## Triage Factors
Prioritization across 20+ fires weighs values at risk (life/safety/property first), burn severity (e.g., high dNBR), downstream threats (flood/erosion), phase urgency, and resource constraints. Critical data: fire size/perimeter, containment %, severity maps (MTBS), weather forecasts, infrastructure exposure (trails/roads), crew availability. Coordinators balance via risk scores, deltas (e.g., overnight changes), and regional overload.[8][9][10][3]

## Dashboard Essentials
At-a-glance: Portfolio summary (X critical/high of Y total fires, by phase/region), top 3-5 escalations (triage scores with hovers), 24h deltas, map with severity-coded markers synced to list. Hunt-for items: Anomaly trends (worsening despite containment), resource gaps, briefing summaries. Alerts: Imminent storms on high-risk burns, BAER deadlines, crew exposures.[11][12][7]

| Role | Key View |
|------|----------|
| Regional Coordinator | Multi-forest triage: Risk concentration, 72h priorities, executive summaries [10] |
| District Specialist | Single-fire drill-down: Agent briefings, exports (TRACS/FSVeg), compliance paths [11] |
| Field Team | Offline-safe: Safety alerts, work orders, cached maps [11] |

## Pain Points
Tracking fails on siloed data (14+ systems), manual synthesis (2h daily briefings), coordination gaps (BAER to restoration handoffs), and changing conditions outpacing analysis. Breakdowns occur at transitions (suppression→BAER), unexplained scores, and compliance delays (NEPA memos). Better data needed for: Erosion forecasting, treatment prioritization, cross-domain impacts (burn→trails→timber).[11][3][4][8]

## Terminology Alignment
"BAER" is standard across USFS/BLM/NPS/BIA. Prefer **Rehabilitation** or **Restoration** over "Recovery" for long-term (BAR program). Use FSMFSH, MTBS, dNBR; avoid over-generalizing phases to match practitioner talk (e.g., "post-containment threats").[13][1][3][6]
