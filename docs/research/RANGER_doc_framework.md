# RANGER Decision Support System: Authoritative Document Framework

## Executive Summary

This curated document corpus is designed to ground the RANGER system's four specialist agents (Burn Analyst, Trail Assessor, Cruising Assistant, NEPA Advisor) in the actual regulatory, procedural, and technical guidance that Forest Service practitioners rely on in field and office decision-making. The framework reflects current Forest Service policy (as of December 2025) and accounts for recent regulatory changes.

### Integration Points & Cross-References

1. **BAER Assessment Triggers NEPA Compliance Check:**
   - Burn Analyst identifies "burned-area emergency" → NEPA Advisor confirms whether CE applies (36 CFR 220.6(e)(13) fire salvage provision) or if EA required

2. **Timber Salvage Sale Design Relies on Burn Severity & Cruising Data:**
   - Burn Analyst maps severity, debris-flow risk → Cruising Assistant uses MTBS/soil burn maps to stratify cruise, identify high-priority salvage areas → Appraisal reflects deterioration timeline

3. **Trail Restoration Must Address Accessibility & Design Standards:**
   - Trail Assessor assesses damage against TMOs → applies FSTAG standards for new/altered sections → NEPA Advisor determines if reconstruction is categorically excluded or needs EA

4. **Post-Fire Recovery Sequencing:**
   - FSM 2500-2523 specifies timeline: immediate BAER (weeks 1-3) → extended assessment (months 1-6) → rehabilitation planning (months 6-12) → long-term restoration
   - Agents coordinate decisions across phases

---

## DOCUMENT SOURCING NOTES

**Public vs. Internal Access:**
- Most Tier 1 regulatory documents (36 CFR 220, 223) are public via Federal Register/eCFR
- FSH/FSM handbooks are official agency policy; portions publicly available, full copies accessible to USDA personnel
- MTBS, USGS debris-flow, and research publications are freely public
- Regional guidance (R5 Recovery Plan, Postfire Restoration Framework) are public PDFs

**Regulatory Changes & Currency:**
- CEQ regulations rescinded February 2025; system should reference both rescinded rules (for context) and current CEQ guidance memo
- Forest Service is revising NEPA implementing procedures per EO 14154; framework should remain flexible for procedural updates
- Executive Order 14225 (March 2025) directing 25% increase in timber harvests may affect appraisal and prioritization methodology; monitor FS responses

**Regional Supplements:**
- Each Regional Forester may issue regional guidance and policy letters specific to post-fire recovery
- RANGER system should accommodate loading of regional-specific guidance documents (Tier 2+ supplements)
- Example: R5, R1, R4, R6 regions may have distinct post-fire protocols

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RANGER DEVELOPMENT

1. **Start with Tier 1 documents** for initial RAG training and baseline agent performance
2. **Add Tier 2 documents progressively** as agents require deeper analysis capability (especially for complex NEPA decisions or edge-case salvage scenarios)
3. **Integrate Tier 3 documents as reference library** rather than primary retrieval sources; useful for disambiguation and expert-level context
4. **Build version control** for FSH/FSM documents, as these are regularly amended; flag documents with recent amendments
5. **Create cross-reference index** mapping regulatory citations (e.g., "36 CFR 220.6(e)(13)") to relevant handbook chapters; this will accelerate NEPA Advisor retrieval
6. **Establish feedback loop** with District Rangers and Regional Foresters to identify missing documents or procedural gaps discovered in field use

---

## FINAL NOTE: THE PRACTITIONER'S PERSPECTIVE

The documents in this framework represent what Forest Service staff *actually use* when preparing post-fire recovery decisions under time pressure. A District Ranger at 6 AM briefing will:

1. Pull up the fire perimeter and MTBS burn severity (Burn Analyst's map)
2. Check the BAER directive and FSM 2500 checklist to confirm whether an emergency exists
3. Scan FSH 1909.15 Chapter 30 to see if timber salvage can be categorically excluded from further NEPA
4. Ask the Cruising Assistant for timber volume estimates using FSH 2409.12 methodology
5. Review FSTAG and TMO guidance for trail closure decisions
6. Prepare a decision memo citing 36 CFR 220 and the relevant CE category

This framework ensures RANGER supports that workflow with authoritative, current, and legally defensible sources. The system's value will be measured not by comprehensiveness, but by practitioners' willingness to trust its recommendations in high-stakes recovery decisions.
